\usage{
dbbtest(formula, data, epsilon = 10^(-5), link.mean, link.precision)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{symbolic description of the model (set: z ~ x or z ~ x | v); see details below.}

\item{data}{arguments considered in the formula description. This is usually a data frame composed by:
(i) the response with bounded continuous observations (0 < z_i < 1),
(ii) covariates for the mean submodel (columns of matrix x) and
(iii) covariates for the precision submodel (columns of matrix v).}

\item{epsilon}{tolerance value to control the convergence criterion in the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (default = 10^(-5)).}

\item{link.mean}{a string containing the link function for the mean.
The possible link functions for the mean are "logit","probit", "cauchit", "cloglog".}

\item{link.precision}{a string containing the link function the precision parameter.
The possible link functions for the precision parameter are "identity", "log", "sqrt", "inverse".}
}
\value{
Object of class dbbtest, which is a list containing two elements. The 1st one is a table of terms
considered in the decision rule of the test; they are sum(z2/n) = sum_{i=1}^{n}(z_i^2)/n, sum(quasi_mu) = sum_{i=1}^{n}(tilde{mu_i}^2 + tilde{mu_i}(1-tilde{mu_i})/2)
|D_bessel| and |D_beta| as indicated in the main reference. The 2nd term of the list is the name of the selected model (bessel or beta).
}
\description{
Function to run the discrimination test between beta and bessel regressions (DBB).
