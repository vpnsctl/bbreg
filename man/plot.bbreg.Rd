\usage{
\method{plot}{bbreg}(x, which = c(1, 2, 3, 4), ask = TRUE, main = "", qqline = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class "bbreg" containing results from the fitted model.
If the model is fitted with envelope = 0, the Q-Q plot will be produced without envelopes.}

\item{which}{a number of a vector of numbers between 1 and 4. Plot 1:
Residuals vs. Index; Plot 2: Q-Q Plot (if the fit contains simulated envelopes,
the plot will be with the simulated envelopes); Plot 3: Fitted means vs. Response;
Plot 4: Residuals vs. Fitted means.}

\item{ask}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, the user is aked before each plot.}

\item{main}{character; title to be placed at each plot additionally (and above) all captions.}

\item{qqline}{logical; if \code{TRUE} and the fit does \emph{not} contain simulated
envelopes, a qqline will be added to the normal Q-Q plot.}

\item{...}{graphical parameters to be passed.}
}

Function to build useful plots for bounded regression models.
