# The *bbreg* package

The *bbreg* package deals with regression models with response variables being continuous
and bounded. It currently provides implementation of two regression models: beta
regression <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0266476042000214501> and bessel regression <https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05157>. For both of these models, the estimation is 
done with the EM-algorithm. The EM-algorithm approach for beta regression
was developed in <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00949655.2017.1350679>.

## Vignette
